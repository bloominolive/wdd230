        <p>The target audience for the page will include those who are looking for residence in the area, events, 
            community opportunities, weather, and more. The demographic is just over half female with the median age 
            being 33.9. The average family size is 3.27 so our target has a small family they're considering when 
            using this site. The median income for families is $62,143 which is about double the national median. 
            (Click <a href = "https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/orlando-fl-population"><b>here</b></a>

            <p>Snapfish uses white space and clean design really well on their home page.
                Their logo has space around to where it is clear and readable, the margins
                between elements on the page are clean with breathing room, and the images 
                with promotions aren't too busy with words that we can't focus on the main 
                message being conveyed. Our eyes are intentionally drawn to what they want
                us to look at to start down the sales funnel.

        <img alt="snapfish home" src="images/behrhome.png">
        <p>Behr is known for their excellent brand of paint for consumers and pros, so 
            it makes sense that their site makes excellent use of design elements like 
            visual hierarchy. Their main message on the promotional item pictured here is, 
            brilliantly, like a double call to action. They know their customers are 
            "doers" so it makes sense that the first thing you want to do is "decide", then
            it draws your eye above that message where you can see the "Behr Designer
            Collection". This lets the consumer know they have the resources to act on their 
            decision. Finally, the eye is drawn to the call to action button where we can 
            explore the collection and find our resources for inspiration. I also appreciate 
            that their logo and company name is larger in the top section of the viewport so 
            it's easy to remember the company.
